      "description":"Detection and response application for Crypto Security. Automatically classifies alerts as false positives, incidents, or security events and autonomously decides whether to escalate or close them. Reduces operational load, eliminates manual errors, and speeds up response times.",
      "problem": "The alert-management process was fully manual: each alert took 1\u20132 hours, caused frequent errors, and slowed down operations. There was no clear architecture or centralized system for classification, escalation, and analysis. Internal teams relied on slow and inconsistent human reviews.",
      "solution": "I designed and built AutomateX from scratch \u2014 a full platform with Hexagonal Architecture, C4 diagrams, ADRs, and clearly defined use cases. I implemented automated classification flows using LLMs combined with domain rules. I standardized documentation and patterns to streamline onboarding.",
      "result": "Drastically reduced processing time: from 1\u20132 hours \u2192 3\u20136 seconds. Eliminated manual errors and improved traceability. The tool was adopted by 4+ internal teams as an operational reference. Significant improvement in operational efficiency and data quality."
